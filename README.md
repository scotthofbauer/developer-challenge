# The Idea

This repo is an NFT Marketplace with the ability to mint, transfer, and redeem NFTs from a fake popular shoe brand - Hoff Industries.

### The idea behind this project is as follows:

Hoff Industries is an up and coming hot startup that has been producing the most marketable shoes in the country. Each time Hoff Industries releases a new shoe, their inventory is immediately sold out and these shoes become worth more than the original price on secondary markets.

With such an exponential demand and possibility of high resell value. Hoff Industries has encountered some issue with scammers claiming to own a pair of exlusive Hoff Industry sneakers and reselling counterfits. The community has been outspoken about this problem and Hoff Industry is starting to see a dip in sales due to these scammers.

### Solution:

Hoff Industries is releasing an NFT platform that will allow consumers to buy the right to own a shoe via ERC-721 tokens. By purchasing an NFT, that NFT will provide proof of ownership of an exlusive Hoff Industry shoe.

When a consumer purchases an NFT, that individual has two options. First, they can redeem the NFT, which will allow them to actually recieve the manufactured shoe. Conversly, they would have the option to sell the NFT to another consumer for possibly a higher price than what that individual paid for.

Hoff Industries NFT marketplace provides a secure and trustworthy place to not only mint new NFTs but also encourages the secondary market of peer to peer buying and selling the ownership of an NFT.
